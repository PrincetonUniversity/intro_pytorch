The Normalize transform normalizes the data to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

```
Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))
```

The mean is 0.1307 and the standard deviation is 0.381.

When using a pre-trained model is it important to know how the input data should be transformed before passing it through the model.
